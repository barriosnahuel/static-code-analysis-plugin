## History

# v2.2
* **2.2.0 - Unreleased**

 Bug fixes:
 * Android lint outputs no longer includes "fatal" reports, which are generated by `:lintVital*` tasks

 Improvements:
 * CPDTask can now ignore literals, identifiers and configure language.
    Plugin defaults to java, ignoring literals and identifiers.
 * Android lint rules XML can now be confgured through DSL. Supports remote files.
 * Android lint honors `ignoreErrors` settings.
 * Android lint can be disabled / enabled through the DSL. When disabled, the task will simply be SKIPPED.
    `LintVital*` tasks will still run, since that is part of the build step for release builds, not the check step.
 * Android will not warn for usage of deprecated `useJack` option anymore.
 * Upgraded Checkstyle to 7.1
 * PMD can now cache remote config files, and use them when offline.
 * Android lint XML report is now written under `$buildDir/reports/android/android-lint.xml`
    for consistency with other tools. This name is the same regardless of the used plugin version.
    HTML report is untouched.
